This site contains all material related to the application of web based user interfaces (R-Shiny) to Health Economics and Decision Science. There are three main parts to the repository: 
- a pre-print [publication](https://github.com/RobertASmith/healthecon_shiny/blob/master/Publication/Making%20health%20economic%20models%20Shiny%20A%20tutorial.pdf) discussing the merits of web based user interfaces for health economists and outlining an overview of the process of making models Shiny.
- a simple Shiny web [application](https://robertasmith.shinyapps.io/sick_sicker/) which can be replicated by the user by cloning this repo or copying the two files in the [App](https://github.com/RobertASmith/healthecon_shiny/tree/master/App) folder. 
- a [tutorial](https://github.com/RobertASmith/healthecon_shiny/tree/master/Tutorial) which goes into more detail than the publication describing the code for the simple app.

Rob & Paul have worked on a variety of projects using R-Shiny, ranging from economic models of physical activity & [female genital mutilation](https://srhr.org/fgmcost/cost-calculator/), direct-acting oral anticoagulants, adherence interventions for cystic fibrosis and decision modelling for [parkrunUK](http://iol-map.shef.ac.uk/). They are keen to collaborate with others interested in improving transparency and reproducability in health economics. For more information see their [website](https://www.darkpeakanalytics.com).
